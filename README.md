# AWS s3 on event notification trigger lambda

## S3 to Email Notification System

This project automates email notifications whenever new files are uploaded to an S3 bucket. It enhances efficiency and ensures timely updates.

## How It Works

1. **S3 Bucket**: Acts as the trigger for the notification system. When a new file is uploaded, it initiates the process.
2. **Lambda Function**: A Lambda function is triggered by new objects uploaded to the S3 bucket and handles the email notification process.
3. **Event Notifications**: S3 event notifications are configured to activate the Lambda function upon new file uploads.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Rigorous testing ensures that emails are sent correctly for various file types and upload scenarios.

## Benefits

- **Improved Efficiency**: Automates the email notification process, reducing manual effort.
- **Timely Updates**: Ensures prompt communication whenever new files are uploaded to the S3 bucket.
- **Scalability**: Easily adapts to changes in workload volume, supporting increased or decreased file uploads.
